# Pay - Payments engine for Ruby on Rails
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/excid3/pay.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/excid3/pay)

Pay is a payments engine for Ruby on Rails 4.2 and higher.

**Current Payment Providers**
* Stripe (API version [2018-08-23](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2018-08-23) or higher required)
* Braintree

Want to add a new payment provider? Contributions are welcome and the instructions [are here](https://github.com/jasoncharnes/pay/wiki/New-Payment-Provider).

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pay'

# To use Stripe, also include:
gem 'stripe', '< 5.0', '>= 2.8'
gem 'stripe_event', '~> 2.2'

# To use Braintree + PayPal, also include:
gem 'braintree', '< 3.0', '>= 2.92.0'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install pay
```

If you face: `NoMethodError (undefined method 'stripe_customer' for #<User:0x00007fbc34b9bf20>)` after adding the gem.

Fully restart your Rails application `bin/spring stop && rails s`

## Setup
#### Migrations
This engine will create a subscription model and the neccessary migrations for the model you want to make "billable." The most common use case for the billable model is a User.

To add the migrations to your application, run the following migration:

`$ bin/rails pay:install:migrations`

This will install two migrations:
- db/migrate/create_subscriptions.pay.rb
- db/migrate/add_fields_to_users.pay.rb
- db/migrate/create_charges.pay.rb

#### Non-User Model
If you need to use a model other than `User`, check out the [wiki page](https://github.com/jasoncharnes/pay/wiki/Model-Other-Than-User).

#### Run the Migrations
Finally, run the migrations with `$ rake db:migrate`

#### Stripe
You'll need to add your private Stripe API key to your Rails secrets `config/secrets.yml`, credentials `rails credentials:edit`

```yaml
development:
  stripe:
    private_key: xxxx
    public_key: yyyy
    signing_secret: zzzz
```

You can also use the `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY` and `STRIPE_SIGNING_SECRET`
environment variables.

#### Background jobs
If a users email is updated and they have a `processor_id` set, we'll enqueue a background job (EmailSyncJob) to sync the email with the payment processor. It's important you set a queue_adapter for this to happen, if you don't the code will be executed immediately upon user update. [More information here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v4.2/active_job_basics.html#backends)

## Usage
Include the `Pay::Billable` module in the model you want to know about subscriptions.

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Pay::Billable
end
```

**To see how to use Stripe Elements JS & Devise, [click here](https://github.com/jasoncharnes/pay/wiki/Using-Stripe-Elements-and-Devise).**

## Configuration

You can create an initializer `config/initializers/pay.rb`

```ruby
Pay.setup do |config|
  config.billable_class = 'User'
  config.billable_table = 'users'

  config.chargeable_class = 'Pay::Charge'
  config.chargeable_table = 'charges'

  # For use in the receipt/refund/renewal mailers
  config.business_name = "Business Name"
  config.business_address = "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW"
  config.application_name = "My App"
  config.support_email = "helpme@example.com"

  config.send_emails = true
end
```

This allows you to create your own Charge class for instance, which could add receipt functionality:

```ruby
class Charge < Pay::Charge
  def receipts
    # do some receipts stuff using the https://github.com/excid3/receipts gem
  end
end

Pay.setup do |config|
  config.chargeable_class = 'Charge'
end
```

### Generators

#### Email Templates

If you want to modify the email templates, you can copy over the view files using:

```
bin/rails generate pay:email_views
```

## Emails

### Stripe

Emails can be enabled/disabled using the `send_emails` configuration option (enabled per default). When enabled, the following emails will be sent:

- When a charge succeeded
- When a charge was refunded
- When a subscription is about to renew

## User API


#### Trials

You can check if the user is on a trial by simply asking:

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'michael@bluthcompany.co')
user.on_trial?
#=> true or false
```

#### Generic Trials

Trials that don't require cards upfront simply

```ruby
user = User.create(
  email: 'michael@bluthcompany.co',
  trial_ends_at: 30.days.from_now
)

user.on_generic_trial?
#=> true
```

#### Creating a Charge

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'michael@bluthcompany.co')
user.processor = 'stripe'
user.card_token = 'stripe-token'
user.charge(1500) # $15.00 USD

user = User.find_by(email: 'michael@bluthcompany.co')
user.processor = 'braintree'
user.card_token = 'nonce'
user.charge(1500) # $15.00 USD
```

The `charge` method takes the amount in cents as the primary argument.

You may pass optional arguments that will be directly passed on to
either Stripe or Braintree. You can use these options to charge
different currencies, etc.

#### Creating a Subscription

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'michael@bluthcompany.co')
user.processor = 'stripe'
user.card_token = 'stripe-token'
user.subscribe
```

A `card_token` must be provided as an attribute.

The subscribe method has three optional arguments with default values.

```ruby
def subscribe(name: 'default', plan: 'default', **options)
  ...
end
```

##### Name
Name is an internally used name for the subscription.

##### Plan
Plan is the plan ID from the payment processor.

#### Retrieving a Subscription from the Database
```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'gob@bluthcompany.co')
user.subscription
```

#### Checking a User's Subscription Status

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'george.senior@bluthcompany.co')
user.subscribed?
```

The `subscribed?` method has two optional arguments with default values.

```ruby
def subscribed?(name: 'default', plan: nil)
  ...
end
```

##### Name
Name is an internally used name for the subscription.

##### Plan
Plan is the plan ID from the payment processor.

##### Processor
Processor is the string value of the payment processor subscription. Pay currently only supports Stripe, but other implementations are welcome.

#### Retrieving a Payment Processor Account

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'george.michael@bluthcompany.co')
user.customer
```

#### Updating a Customer's Credit Card

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'tobias@bluthcompany.co')
user.update_card('stripe-token')
```

#### Retrieving a Customer's Subscription from the Processor

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'lucille@bluthcompany.co')
user.processor_subscription(subscription_id)
```

## Subscription API
#### Checking a Subscription's Trial Status

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'lindsay@bluthcompany.co')
user.subscription.on_trial?
```

#### Checking a Subscription's Cancellation Status

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'buster@bluthcompany.co')
user.subscription.cancelled?
```

#### Checking a Subscription's Grace Period Status

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'her?@bluthcompany.co')
user.subscription.on_grace_period?
```

#### Checking to See If a Subscription Is Active

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'carl.weathers@bluthcompany.co')
user.subscription.active?
```

#### Cancel a Subscription (At End of Billing Cycle)

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'oscar@bluthcompany.co')
user.subscription.cancel
```

#### Cancel a Subscription Immediately

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'annyong@bluthcompany.co')
user.subscription.cancel_now!
```

#### Swap a Subscription to another Plan

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'steve.holt@bluthcompany.co')
user.subscription.swap("yearly")
```

#### Resume a Subscription on a Grace Period

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'steve.holt@bluthcompany.co')
user.subscription.resume
```

#### Retrieving the Subscription from the Processor

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'lucille2@bluthcompany.co')
user.subscription.processor_subscription
```
