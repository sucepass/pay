### 2.2.2

### 2.2.1

* [NEW] Allow passing `?back=/path/to/item` for customizing the back link for SCA payments page

### 2.2.0

Stripe API 2020-08-27 changes:

* Use `proration_behavior` instead of `prorate` for Stripe subscription changes
* Switch to `::Stripe::Subscription.create` instead of `customer.subscriptions` as Stripe no longer includes this by default for performance
* Set Stripe API version for easier gem management

### 2.1.3

* Add support for `quantity` option on `subscribe` for subscription quantities
* Added `Pay::BraintreeAuthorizationError` to catch Braintree actions
  with malformed data or unauthorized API access.

### 2.1.2

* [FIX] Remove old billable migration

### 2.1.1

* [FIX] The `charge` method now raises `Pay::BraintreeError` when a
  charge fails. This makes it work consistently with the Stripe
  implementation which raises an error on charge failure.

### 2.1.0

* [BREAKING] Subscription & Charge associations to `owner` are now polymorphic.

  Requires adding `owner_type:string` to both Pay::Charge and Pay::Subscription models and setting the value for all existing records to your model name.

```ruby
class AddOwnerTypeToPay < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_column :pay_charges, :owner_type, :string
    add_column :pay_subscriptions, :owner_type, :string

    # Backfill owner_type column to match your Billable model
    Pay::Charge.update_all owner_type: "User"
    Pay::Subscription.update_all owner_type: "User"
  end
end
```

  `Pay.billable_class` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version. You should also update your existing Pay migrations to reference the `:users` table rather than `Pay.billable_class` and any other code you may have that references this method.

### 2.0.3

* [FIX] Stripe subscription cancel shouldn't change status
* [FIX] Stripe test payment methods should now work (ie. `pm_card_visa`)

  class

* [BREAKING] Drops Ruby 2.4 support
* [BREAKING] `automount_webhook_routes` config option has been renamed to `automount_routes`
* [BREAKING]`webhooks_path` config option has been renamed to `routes_path`
* Added `status` column to payments to keep in sync with Stripe. We're
  also adding statuses to Braintree subscriptions to keep them in sync as best we can.
* Added `payments#show` route to handle SCA payments that require action
* Added webhook handler for payments that require action
* Added `trial_period_days` when creating a subscription that works the
  same on Stripe and Braintree
